ByteGen
-------
We have staging servers for our various events, and ByteGen is a separate fake
event we can use to test weirder deployment scenarios.  For example, this was
the first time we tested deploying all roles to the same server.

In case it's not clear, "ByteGen" is approximately 8x better than BitGen.

I say "approximately" because the last bit might be a checksum.
